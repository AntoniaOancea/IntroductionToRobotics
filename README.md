  ### This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue)of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers.
  ### Components: 
      RGB LED (at least 1)
      Potentiometers (at least 3)
      Resistors and wires as needed

  ### Task
      Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  
      This control must leverage digital electronics.  
      Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  a mapped value to the LED pins.
